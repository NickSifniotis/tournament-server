/**
 * Created by nsifniotis on 2/09/15.
 *
 * An interface for the player manager code.
 *
 * This layer needs to be provided by the academic / instructor.
 * It is the final connection between the tournament server and the student's codes.
 *
 * The tourney server works with Objects of undeclared type. Students probably won't be expected
 * to deal with Objects. They will have Strings or maybe more complex GameState objects. Or maybe they
 * will not even be working in Java, it might be Haskell or assembler or brainfuck. Who am I to judge
 * them based on their choice of programming language.
 *
 * The point is that the tourney simulator does use Java and so there needs to be some sort of plugin
 * interfacey type thing that connects the player submissions to the tourney system.
 *
 * Luckily it's only one function. But lord knows how convoluted it's going to need to be if they
 * are working in Haskell or whatever.
