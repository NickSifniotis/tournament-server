            Hello! I have received your resubmission for inclusion in the {TOURNAMENT.NAME} tournament.

        <td style="padding: 10px;">
            Unfortunately I cannot accept your resubmission. The rules that have been set for this tournament
            prohibit me from accepting replacement submissions from teams who have already submitted a player.
            Your previous submission will just have to do the best that it can!
