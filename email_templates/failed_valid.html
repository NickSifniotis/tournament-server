            Hello! I have received your submission for inclusion in the {TOURNAMENT.NAME} tournament.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding: 10px;">
            Unfortunately, your submission failed the code verification tests that have been set by your instructor.
            I do not know what these tests are or what you did wrong (I'm just the middleman) so my advice to you is:
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure you have followed your instructor's instructions perfectly.</li>
                <li>Are your file names correct? Capitalisation correct? Path names correct?</li>
                <li>Don't include dodgy code that is designed to take me down. You won't win that game.</li>
            </ul>
            If that doesn't help, forward this email to your instructor and let them take a look at it.
            I have included your submission as an attachment.
