            I have been designed to shut down players that pose a threat to my stability.
            There are a number of events that can trigger disqualification, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Taking too long to make a move.</li>
                <li>Making no move.</li>
                <li>Making an illegal move.</li>
                <li>Attempting to crash me.</li>
            </ul>
            I don't know which of these your player did, so I have attached the game log file to this
            email.
