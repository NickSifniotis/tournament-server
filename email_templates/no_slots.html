            Hello! I have received your submission for inclusion in the {TOURNAMENT.NAME} tournament.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="padding: 10px;">
            Unfortunately I cannot accept your submission. There is only room for {TOURNAMENT.SLOTS} players
            to complete in {TOURNAMENT.NAME}, and I already have that number of players marshalled and ready to go.
        </td>

        <td style="padding: 10px;">
            Next time, get in faster - or complain to your supervisor that his tournament is too small!
