            One of the players in a game that you were playing in did something unexpected and triggered an abnormal
            termination of the game. That player has now been removed from the competition.

            Don't worry! Your player didn't cause it, and hasn't been harmed at all.

            The game was not able to reach a normal ending, however, and everyone's scores are lost. As a result,
            everyone - except the disqualified player - will be receiving an equal share of the total points on
            offer in that game.

            This may be very good or very bad for you, depending on whether you were coming first or last in that game.
            In any event the game log is attached so you'll know exactly who to blame.
