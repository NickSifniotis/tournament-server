            Hello! I have received your resubmission for inclusion in the {TOURNAMENT.NAME} tournament.

        <td style="padding: 10px;">
            Unfortunately I cannot accept your submission. The tournament has already begun, and the rules
            set by your instructor prohibit me from accepting resubmission of players once the gaming
            gets underway. Your previous submission will have to do the best that it can!

            Good luck!
